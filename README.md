# minishell

The minishell project is a program that simulates the behavior of the command shell (also known as the terminal or command prompt) in a Unix-like operating system. When you run the minishell program, it will display a prompt where you can type a command and press enter to execute it. The minishell program is able to parse the command and arguments you enter, and execute the appropriate program. It also has a few built-in functions such as "echo", "cd", "setenv", "unsetenv", "env", and "exit". The minishell program is able to handle expansions (e.g., "$" and "~") and quotes, and has additional features such as the ability to handle relative and absolute paths when using the "cd" command and the ability to print error messages when an error occurs.

# How to use it

Using ``make`` will create the minishell executable.

And then,
simply run it with :
```
./minishell
```

Only allowed readymade functions in this project are listed below. Everything
else coded by me, including my own printf, ls-command and c-library.

Allowed readymade functions in this project:

    - malloc, free
    - access
    - open, close, read, write
    - opendir, readdir, closedir
    - getcwd, chdir
    - stat, lstat, fstat
    - fork, execve
    - wait, waitpid, wait3, wait4
    - signal, kill
    - exit

Mandatory requirements of the project:

    - You must program a miniUNIXcommand interpreter.
    - This interpreter must display a prompt (a simple "$>" for example) and
    wait tillyou type a command line, validated by pressing enter.
    - The prompt is shown again only once the command has been completely
    executed.
    - The command lines are simple, no pipes, no redirections or any other
    advanced functions.
    - The executable are those you can find in the paths indicated in the
    PATH variable.
    - In cases where the executable cannot be found, it has to show an error
    message anddisplay the prompt again.
    - You must manage the errors without using errno, by displaying a message
    adaptedto the error output.
    - You must deal correctly with the PATH and the environment (copy of
    systemchar**environ).
    - You must implement a series of builtins: echo,cd,setenv,unsetenv,env,exit.
    - You can choose as a reference whatever shell you prefer.
    - You must manage expansions $ and Ìƒ

Additional features:

    - Handling of quotes, also if quote is left open
    - Error message printing
    
Add on features:

    - ~ (tilde) with / + - behind it
    - $ expansion working
    - cd [dir] also works with no dir and - Handles relative and absolute paths.
    Checks the path for any errors, error handling written by hand with lstat(),
    stat() and access(). Handles . and ..
    - setenv [VAR] [word]
    - unsetenv [var]
    - all error are handled manually and error messages printed to the fd2
